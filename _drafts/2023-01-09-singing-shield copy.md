"The reason why singing is such a splendid shield agaisnt the fiery darts of the devil is that it greatly helps us to forget him, and he cannot endure being forgotten. He likes us to be occupied with him, with what he is doing (our temptations), with his victories (our falls), with anything but the glorious Lord. So sing. Never be afraid of singing too much. We are much more likely to sing too little.
