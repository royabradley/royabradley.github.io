This site is primarily a place for me to process and document my interests and projects, which reflect my work as a Christian minister in the classical Reformed, evangelical tradition. I currently serve as the associate pastor at <a href="https://gcov.org">Grace Covenant Presbyterian Church</a> (a member of the <a href="https://crecchurches.org">Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches)</a> in Nacogdoches, Texas. The views and opinions expressed on this site are solely those of the proprietor and do not necessarily reflect the views of his employer or any affiliated organizations.

<blockquote align="left"><p style="font-size: medium">Good human work honors God's work. Good work uses no thing without respect, both for what it is in itself and for its origin. It uses neither tool nor material that it does not respect and that it does not love.... To work without pleasure or affection, to make a product that is not both useful and beautiful, is to dishonor God, nature, the thing that is made, and whomever it is made for. This is blasphemy: to make shoddy work of the work of God.</p><figcaption align="right"><p style="font-size: medium">— Wendell Berry, <em>Our Real Work</em></p></figcaption></blockquote>

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
