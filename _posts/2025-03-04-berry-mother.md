<blockquote>
I was your rebellious son,<br>  
do you remember? Sometimes<br>  
I wonder if you do remember,<br>  
so complete has your forgiveness been.<br>  
<br>
So complete has your forgiveness been<br>  
I wonder sometimes if it did not<br>  
precede my wrong, and I erred,<br>  
safe found, within your love,<br>  
<br>
prepared ahead of me, the way home,<br>  
or my bed at night, so that almost<br>  
I should forgive you, who perhaps<br>  
foresaw the worst that I might do,<br>  
<br>
and forgave before I could act,<br>  
causing me to smile now, looking back,<br>  
to see how paltry was my worst,<br>  
compared to your forgiveness of it<br>  
<br>
already given. And this, then,<br>  
is the vision of that Heaven of which<br>  
we have heard, where those who love<br>  
each other have forgiven each other,<br>  
<br>
where, for that, the leaves are green,<br>  
the light a music in the air,<br>  
and all is unentangled,<br> 
and all is undismayed.
