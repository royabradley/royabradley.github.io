<blockquote>
    A healthy Christian culture would manifest:
    - A love of beauty permeating every part of life
    - A deep respect for the majesty and liberty of God
    - A holy recognition of the deep biblical antithesis
    - Humility in covenantal redemption
    - Laughter as a habit of life
    - A devotion to celebration--feasting and lovemaking
    - The centrality of the Church
    - A humble submission to godly traditions
    - The peace of federal headship in marriage
    - A soulful nurturing of children for millennia
    - A community shaped by rural rhythms
    - Self-responsibility and a fading state
    - An acknowledgement of creational hierarchies
    - A harmony of gratitude and discipline in developing technologies
    - The predominance of poetic over rationalistic knowledge
    - A confidence in the triumph of the cross
