## TikZ

[TikZ](https://tikz.net/) is a powerful LaTeX-based drawing tool powered by [TikZJax](https://tikzjax.com/). You can easily port TikZ drawings from papers, posters, and notes. For example, we can use the following code to illustrate Euler’s formula $ e^{i \theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta $:

```markdown
<script type="text/tikz">
\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
      \filldraw[fill=cyan!10, draw=blue, thick] (0,0) circle (2cm);

      \draw[->, thick] (-2.5,0) -- (2.5,0) node[right] {Re};
      \draw[->, thick] (0,-2.5) -- (0,2.5) node[above] {Im};

      \draw[->, thick, color=purple] (0,0) -- (1.5,1.5);
      \node[color=purple] at (1.1, 1.7) {$e^{i\theta}$};

      \draw[thick] (0.7,0) arc (0:45:0.7);
      \node at (0.9, 0.3) {$\theta$};

      \draw[dashed, color=gray] (1.5,1.5) -- (1.5,0) node[below, black] {$\cos \theta$};
      \draw[dashed, color=gray] (1.5,1.5) -- (0,1.5) node[left, black] {$\sin \theta$};
      \node at (2.2, 0) [below] {1};
      \node at (0, 2.2) [left] {$i$};
      \node at (1.5,1.5) [above right, color=blue] {$(\cos \theta \, \sin \theta)$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
</script>
```

The rendered output is shown below, displayed as a vector graphic：

<script type="text/tikz">
\begin{document}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
      \filldraw[fill=cyan!10, draw=blue, thick] (0,0) circle (2cm);

      \draw[->, thick] (-2.5,0) -- (2.5,0) node[right] {Re};
      \draw[->, thick] (0,-2.5) -- (0,2.5) node[above] {Im};

      \draw[->, thick, color=purple] (0,0) -- (1.5,1.5);
      \node[color=purple] at (1.1, 1.7) {$e^{i\theta}$};

      \draw[thick] (0.7,0) arc (0:45:0.7);
      \node at (0.9, 0.3) {$\theta$};

      \draw[dashed, color=gray] (1.5,1.5) -- (1.5,0) node[below, black] {$\cos \theta$};
      \draw[dashed, color=gray] (1.5,1.5) -- (0,1.5) node[left, black] {$\sin \theta$};
      \node at (2.2, 0) [below] {1};
      \node at (0, 2.2) [left] {$i$};
      \node at (1.5,1.5) [above right, color=blue] {$(\cos \theta \, \sin \theta)$};
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}
</script>

## Typograms

[Typograms](https://google.github.io/typograms/) are a way of combining text and graphics to convey information in a clear and visually engaging manner. Typograms are particularly effective for illustrating simple diagrams, charts, and concept visuals where text and graphics are closely integrated. The following example demonstrates a simple Typogram:

````
```typograms
             ___________________
            /                  /|
           /__________________/ |
          |                  |  |
          |     Distill      |  |
          |                  |  |
          |                  | /
          |__________________|/
```
````

The rendered output is shown below：

```typograms
             ___________________
            /                  /|
           /__________________/ |
          |                  |  |
          |     Distill      |  |
          |                  |  |
          |                  | /
          |__________________|/
```

## Layouts

The main text column is referred to as the body.
It is the assumed layout of any direct descendants of the `d-article` element.

<div class="fake-img l-body">
  <p>.l-body</p>
</div>

For images you want to display a little larger, try `.l-page`:

<div class="fake-img l-page">
  <p>.l-page</p>
</div>

All of these have an outset variant if you want to poke out from the body text a little bit.
For instance:

<div class="fake-img l-body-outset">
  <p>.l-body-outset</p>
</div>

<div class="fake-img l-page-outset">
  <p>.l-page-outset</p>
</div>

Occasionally you’ll want to use the full browser width.
For this, use `.l-screen`.
You can also inset the element a little from the edge of the browser by using the inset variant.

<div class="fake-img l-screen">
  <p>.l-screen</p>
</div>
<div class="fake-img l-screen-inset">
  <p>.l-screen-inset</p>
</div>

The final layout is for marginalia, asides, and footnotes.
It does not interrupt the normal flow of `.l-body` sized text except on mobile screen sizes.

<div class="fake-img l-gutter">
  <p>.l-gutter</p>
</div>

## Sidenotes

Distill supports sidenotes, which are like footnotes but placed in the margin of the page.
They are useful for providing additional context or references without interrupting the flow of the main text.

There are two main ways to create a sidenote:

**Using the `<aside>` tag:**

The following code creates a sidenote with **_distill's styling_** in the margin:

```html
<aside><p>This is a sidenote using aside tag.</p></aside>
```

<aside><p> This is a sidenote using `&lt;aside&gt;` tag</p> </aside>

We can also add images to sidenotes (click on the image to zoom in for a larger version):
{% raw %}

```html
<aside>
  {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/rhino.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
  <p>
    F.J. Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zoological Literature,” Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of
    Scientific Thought and Medical Practice (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s Visual Explanations.
  </p>
</aside>
```

{% endraw %}

<aside>
  {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/rhino.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
  <p>F.J. Cole, “The History of Albrecht Dürer’s Rhinoceros in Zoological Literature,” Science, Medicine, and History: Essays on the Evolution of Scientific Thought and Medical Practice (London, 1953), ed. E. Ashworth Underwood, 337-356. From page 71 of Edward Tufte’s Visual Explanations.</p>
</aside>

Sidenotes can also contain equations and links:

In physics, mass–energy equivalence is the relationship between mass and energy in a system's rest frame. The two differ only by a multiplicative constant and the units of measurement.

<aside>
  <p>This principle is defined by Einstein's famous equation: $E = mc^2$ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence" target="_blank">(Source: Wikipedia)</a></p>
</aside>

**Using the `l-gutter` class:**

The following code creates a sidenote with **_al-folio's styling_** in the margin:

```html
<div class="l-gutter"><p>This is a sidenote using l-gutter class.</p></div>
```

<div class="l-gutter">
  <p> This is a sidenote using `l-gutter` class. </p>
</div>

## Other Typography?

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ (`*asterisks*`) or _underscores_ (`_underscores_`).

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough uses two tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   ⋅⋅\* Unordered sub-list.
3. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   ⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

- Unordered list can use asterisks

* Or minuses

- Or pluses

[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
https://www.example.com or <https://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: https://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: https://www.reddit.com

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
s = "Python syntax highlighting"
print s
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        |      Are      |  Cool |
| ------------- | :-----------: | ----: |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      |   centered    |   $12 |
| zebra stripes |   are neat    |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Markdown | Less      | Pretty     |
| -------- | --------- | ---------- |
| _Still_  | `renders` | **nicely** |
| 1        | 2         | 3          |

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. Oh, you can _put_ **Markdown** into a blockquote.

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a _separate paragraph_.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
This line is only separated by a single newline, so it's a separate line in the _same paragraph_.

<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
    // Wait a split second for Distill to render the shadow DOM
    setTimeout(function() {
      const byline = document.querySelector("d-byline");
      if (byline && byline.shadowRoot) {
        // Find the "Authors" heading inside the shadow root
        const headings = byline.shadowRoot.querySelectorAll("h3");
        headings.forEach(h3 => {
          if (h3.textContent.trim() === "Authors") {
            h3.textContent = "Author";
          }
        });
      }
    }, 100);
  });
