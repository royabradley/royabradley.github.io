## Overview and purpose

The Pentateuch[^1] is the literary and theological foundation upon which all subsequent biblical revelation rests. To miss the message of the Pentateuch is to miss the message of Christian scripture and the Gospel of Jesus Messiah to which it attests. This course proceeds from the conviction that the Pentateuch was originally composed as a single book, and therefore, it "hangs together" as a unified whole and should be studied as such.

This course of study intends to orient the student to the nature of Hebrew narrative as exemplified in the Pentatuech, and to discover how its literary design functions to convey theological truth. We will explore major literary themes and attempt to ascertain their theological import. In particular, we want to become more intimately familiar with the literary nuances, rhetorical strategy, and theological contribution of the Pentateuch so that we may more deeply appreciate how Jesus is the embodiment and fulfillment of what is revealed here. In so doing, we want to promote and model the ethos of a patient, humble, and careful approach to reading scripture,[^2] to delight in the artistic beauty of the Bible, and to glory in the Triune God whom it reveals.

#### Notes

[^1]: Meaning "five books," and referring to the first five books of the Jewish and Christian scriptures: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Dueteronomy. In the Hebrew canon, this collection of scrolls is referred to as the *Torah* ("instruction"). Our English word "Pentateuch" derives from the Greek, *Pentateuchos*, through the Latin, *Pentateuchus*, and then through the Middle English, *Penteteuke*.

[^2]: This is in contrast to what may be called the "instruction manual" approach, which fails to reckon with the particularities and constraints of literary genre and rhetorical strategy. This tends to foster a passive attitute toward the study of scripture that diminishes the reader's responsibility to seriously engage (even wrestle) with the text. The Bible does, indeed, give "instructions" for life, but the *way* in which it communicates this instructional content contrasts greatly with the way an instruction manual portrays its information. Because of this, the analogy runs the risk of being a dangerous half-truth---unhelpful at best and misleading at worst (though I do acknowledge the benign intention of those who may employ it). It is important to pay attention to not just *what* the Bible says, but *how* it says what it says.
